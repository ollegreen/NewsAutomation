# NewsAutomation
Using automator (RPA program on MacOS) and python to generate important headlines each morning.

* The news generator script is in the repository, you can change the geographical area you want your headlines from using the link to the news API. The current ones are Sweden, UK and the US. 
* The automation process through Automator is a bit tricky to show, so I made a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtw1HpFV8

Go enjoy that morning coffee now. 

*Cheers.*
