# NewsAutomation
Using automator (RPA program on MacOS) and python to generate important headlines each morning.

* The news generator script is in the repository, you can change the geographical area you want your headlines from using the link to the news API. 
* The automation process through Automator is a bit tricky to show, so I made a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtw1HpFV8
